<h1 align="center">How To Improve Your UIs</h1>
Ok, you've done it, you've learned UI designing (the basics) but now you want to go further into designing, you want to be able to get commissioned, make your own projects or make your own UIs.

<h2>#1: Use other applications or sites</h2>
Alright, if you're just stuck on Studio, your limitations are pretty obvious, in Studio your limitations are immaculate so you'd have to use 3rd party sites that'd help you with your design such as:

* Figma (Free)
* After Effects (Paid, There's many cracks doe)
* 3rd party sites for icons
  
  * [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com)
  * [Fluent Icons](https://fluenticons.co)
  * [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev)

You can use any of these sites at your will to make logos, icons, custom frames, or making your own designs as a test (in studio it's a lot harder to make your test design)
I will not teach you how to use these apps because then this tutorial will take so long.
