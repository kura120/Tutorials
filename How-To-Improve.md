<h1 align="center">How To Improve Your UIs</h1>
Ok, you've done it; you've learned UI designing (the basics), but now you want to go further into designing; you want to be able to get commissioned, make your projects, or make your UIs.

<h2>#1: Use other applications or sites</h2>
If you're stuck on Studio, your limitations are obvious. Your limitations are immaculate, so you'd have to use 3rd party sites that'd help you with your design, such as:

* Figma (Free)
* Photoshop (Paid; There's a crack, though not recommended)
* After Effects (Paid; There are many cracks, though)
* 3rd party sites for icons
  
  * [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com)
  * [Fluent Icons](https://fluenticons.co)
  * [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev)

You can use any of these sites at your will to make logos, icons, custom frames, or make your designs as a test (in Roblox Studio, it's a lot harder to make your test design)
I will not teach you how to use these apps because then this tutorial will take so long.

<h2>#2: Use Your Imagination</h2>
Just use it, think, and play around. Your imagination, concepts, ideas, creativity, and so on generally get better through practice and feedback from others. Don't refrain from asking others for help or feedback, specifically honest feedback; don't have anyone baby you and tell you that it was great even though it is self-evident that your interface looks displeasing.
